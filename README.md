# AI-Based Automated Financial Fraud Detection System

### Project Overview


The goal of this project is to develop an AI-based system for detecting financial fraud in transactions. This system will use machine learning algorithms to analyze transaction data and identify fraudulent activities in real-time. By leveraging historical transaction data and applying anomaly detection techniques, the system aims to enhance security and reduce the risk of fraudulent activities in financial transactions.

### Objectives
  1. Data Collection: Gather and preprocess historical transaction data.
  2. Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the raw transaction data.
  3. Model Development: Develop and train machine learning models for fraud detection.
  4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.
  5. Deployment: Deploy the model as a web API for real-time fraud detection.
  6. User Interface: Develop a dashboard for monitoring fraud detection results.

### Tools and Technologies
###### Programming Language: Python
###### Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Flask/Django
###### Data Sources: Financial transaction datasets (e.g., Kaggleâ€™s credit card fraud detection dataset)
###### Deployment: Flask/Django for creating a web API, Docker for containerization
###### User Interface: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React or similar frontend framework

### Data Collection
We'll use publicly available financial transaction datasets, such as the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset, for training and evaluating our models.
